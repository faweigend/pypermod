### Setup

One of the requirements it the `three_comp_hyd` project, which has to be installed locally. 
Please get the source code from [here](https://github.com/faweigend/three_comp_hyd) and install via `pip` or `pip3`.

We recommend the use of a virtual environment. Simply install the package by running `pip3 install -e <path_to_project_root>`
