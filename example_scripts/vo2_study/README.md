#### Compare models to data or to each other

Scripts that have a name that starts with `compare` recreate comparison plots or tables of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14295). 
You may use them to investigate the data to see examples for how to use `pypermod` agents to predict TTE trials and VO2.
